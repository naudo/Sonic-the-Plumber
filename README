<strong> Requirements
1) Visual Studio (Express should work... No promises, students can get a free copy of Pro from http://dreamspark.com )
2) XNA Gamestudio 3.x from http://creators.xna.com
3) XBOX 360 users only. Xna creators club memership (again, students can get this for free from http://dreamspark.com )

<strong>Getting started</strong>
This is more of a developer release, so you will need to download and build it yourself. This is a pretty straightforward process though.

1) Download and install XNA Gamestudio from http://creators.xna.com/ . The game was built using XNA 3.x and may not be compatible with the new CTP.
2) Open the solution in Visual Studio and run
3)  If you want to play on xbox and have a creators club membership, deploy like any other game. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203929.aspx
